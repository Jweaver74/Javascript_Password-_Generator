## Why I made this site
This site had had a starter code to work off of. I created the Javascript to have a working application of a password generator, showing off the tools we have learned up to this point with Javascript.



## What I learned
Learned how to utilize Javascript within code to create a more functional and user friendly site. Was able to practice the terminoligy along with the different functions of Javascript.



## Challenges 
After sitting and staring at a black screen for hours on end, i was able to have a tutor get me started in the direction i felt like i wanted to go.  Still have issues getting the proper order of items so that the console log with work with zero issues. My poor spelling skills has also slowed me down, one wrong letter can cuase the site to not work properly.

## Credits
SMU tutor- Anastasia Warren, getting more in dept about functions and log.  She also helped me get started and explained a good path to take to finish.

W3 schools- All the info they provide and terminoligy to help define the correct path ways.

Google- Correct responses for every time i googled a word for help.
